\section{Conclusion}

This project analyzed and predicted video game success using a combination of regression, classification, and clustering. The best predictive model for sales was HistGradientBoosting, while Random Forest feature importance provided interpretable insights into what drives commercial performance.

The main finding is that visibility and engagement (critic/user counts) are the strongest predictors of sales, followed by platform and publisher effects. Review scores matter, but their impact is smaller than the volume of attention. Clustering reveals distinct segments of games that differ in both engagement and sales outcomes.

Limitations include reliance on historical sales data and the absence of marketing spend or advertising variables, which likely influence success. Future work could incorporate richer marketing signals, franchise indicators, or regional sales breakdowns, and explore model calibration for better success classification.
