\section{Codebase \& Reproducibility}

The project is runnable from the repository root via \texttt{python main.py}. The processed dataset is read from \texttt{data/processed/games\_modern.csv}. If needed, the preprocessing step can be reproduced with \texttt{python -m src.data\_loader}. Dependencies are listed in \texttt{requirements.txt} and all stochastic models use fixed seeds (e.g., \texttt{random\_state=42}) for reproducible results.
