This project analyzes and predicts the commercial success of video games, addressing the question: which factors best explain sales performance? We use the Kaggle “Video Game Sales with Ratings” dataset (16k+ titles, 1980--2016) and focus on modern games released from 2005 onward. The target variable is $\log(1+\text{Global\_Sales})$. We compare linear baselines (OLS, Ridge) with non-linear models (Random Forest and HistGradientBoosting) using a fixed 80/20 train--test split. A binary classification task predicts whether a game exceeds 1M global sales using Logistic Regression and Random Forest. For interpretability, we extract feature importance from Random Forest after encoding categorical variables. We also apply numeric-only KMeans clustering with PCA visualization to reveal segments of games based on scores, counts, and release timing. Results show that engagement and visibility (critic/user counts) are the strongest predictors of sales, followed by platform and publisher effects. The best regressor is HistGradientBoosting (test $R^2 \approx 0.56$, RMSE $\approx 0.215$), while the best classifier achieves ROC-AUC $\approx 0.87$. The report emphasizes prediction over causality and discusses limitations related to post-release review signals and missing marketing variables.
