# AI Usage

This project used AI tools as a learning aid and for small refactoring tasks.

Tools used:
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)

How AI was used:
- Refactoring guidance for model pipelines and evaluation utilities.
- Debugging assistance when fixing import and compatibility issues.
- Suggestions for structuring `main.py` and saving metrics/figures.

What I did myself:
- Final decisions on model choice and parameters.
- Data preprocessing logic in `src/data_loader.py`.
- Running experiments, interpreting results, and preparing the report.
